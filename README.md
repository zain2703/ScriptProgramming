Did  "DNA Sequence Analysis" with the python and shell programming.

The DNA anlalysis with bash files can be seen in the DNA Sequence Anlsysis > Part1.sh. 
Which is just a basic anyslsis to get seqeunc of data for different genes

Different techniques applied to get a sequence of data and split different genes sequences using python file. Then to Analysed that gene sequence occurance in data files using matplot library in python.
