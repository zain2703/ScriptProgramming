Did  "DNA Sequence Analysis" with the python and shell programming.
The DNA anlalysis with bash files can be seen in the DNA Sequence Anlsysis > Part1.sh whihc is just a basic anyslsis to get seqeunc of data for different genes.
Different techniques applied to get a sequence of data and split different genes sequences. Analysed that gene sequence occurance in data files using matplot library in python.
