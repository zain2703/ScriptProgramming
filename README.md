Did  "DNA Sequence Analysis" with the python and shell programming.

The DNA anlalysis with bash files can be seen in the DNA Sequence Anlsysis > Part1.sh. 
Which is just a basic anyslsis to get seqeunc of data for different genes

Different techniques applied to get a sequence of data and split different genes sequences using python file. Then to Analysed that gene sequence occurance in data files using matplot library in python.

Also analysed numer of bases of swapped mutation using scatter plots.

Using linear regression to find the line best fit for the swapped mutation using different RMS
